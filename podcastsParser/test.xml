Aug 31, 2018, Part 2
</title><link>https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/tech-changes-the-face-of-death/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The human brain contains an estimated 100 billion neurons. When those cells malfunction, the disrupted process can lead to schizophrenia, PTSD, and other disorders. In his book &lt;em&gt;The Disordered Mind&lt;/em&gt;, Nobel Prize-winning neuropsychiatrist Eric Kandel looks at where the processes fault to give insight into how the brain works. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/order-and-disorder-in-the-human-brain/" target="_blank"&gt;According to Kandel&lt;/a&gt;, the understanding of these disorders offers a chance “to see how our individual experiences and behavior are rooted in the interaction of genes and environment that shapes our brains.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Earlier in 2018, Utah became the 15th state to legalize water cremation, or alkaline hydrolysis. Unlike traditional cremation, which burns human remains at 1,400 degrees Fahrenheit, water cremation uses a mixture of water and lye, along with heat and pressure, to break down the remains. Meanwhile, many cemeteries across the country now offer green burial sites—sites that ban embalming fluid and use biodegradable caskets. &lt;/span&gt;As climate-conscious consumers consider their final arrangements, alternative funerals like a water cremation or a green burial are &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/tech-changes-the-face-of-death/" target="_blank"&gt;becoming more popular in the face of resource-heavy traditional funerals&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

Aug 31, 2018, Part 1
</title><link>https://www.sciencefriday.com/episodes/august-31-2018/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;NASA is exploring a deep-sea volcano off the coast of Hawaii as a test run for human and robotic missions to Mars and beyond. The mission, dubbed SUBSEA, or Systematic Underwater Biogeochemical Science and Exploration Analog, will examine microbial life on the Lō`ihi seamount. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/a-deep-ocean-dive-is-training-nasa-for-space/" target="_blank"&gt;The mission has two objectives&lt;/a&gt;. The first is to learn about the operational and communication challenges of a real space mission through a deep ocean dive. The second is to learn more about the geology and chemistry that support life in the deep ocean, as a glimpse of what alien life might require in places like the oceans of Saturn’s moon Enceladus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve probably had the experience of scrolling through your Instagram feed, coming across a picture of some hidden swimming hole, secluded mountain trail, or pristine beach, and thought, “I want to go THERE.” Popular accounts on Instagram and other social media services can increase the visibility of remote places, making them more accessible and encouraging people to venture into the outdoors. But some are worried that the accounts can attract &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/take-only-pictures-and-dont-geotag-them/" target="_blank"&gt;too much attention to fragile places&lt;/a&gt; that may not be able to withstand hordes of visitors.

&lt;p&gt;On August 23rd, a team of scientists, students, and a professional film crew aboard the research vessel &lt;em&gt;Academik Ioffe&lt;/em&gt; set out from Resolute Bay in Northern Canada. Their mission? To study the arctic environment as part of the Northwest Passage Project. The expedition was supposed to last three weeks, but just one day after the crew embarked the vessel &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/arctic-science-put-on-ice/" target="_blank"&gt;became grounded and the expedition had to be suspended&lt;/a&gt;. Brice Loose, chief scientist aboard the &lt;em&gt;Academik Ioffe&lt;/em&gt;, and microbiologist Mary Thaler, a passenger aboard the vessel, join Ira to share what happened and discuss the science that had to be put on hold.&lt;/p&gt;

For the 30th anniversary of Hawking’s &lt;em&gt;A Brief History of Time&lt;/em&gt;, the SciFri Book Club decided to throw our own party—a Time Traveler Cocktail Party, live at Caveat in New York City!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had hands-on physics demonstrations, built 2018 time capsules, and heard conversations about black holes, gravity and the fabric of our universe with Ryan Mandelbaum (Gizmodo), Rae Paoletta, and physicist Jillian Bellovary (American Museum of Natural History). We also revealed the winning art commissioned as part of a contest challenging artists all over the world to interpret Stephen Hawking’s vivid depictions of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We closed the evening with a poem written by Marie Howe and read by renowned theoretical cosmologist Janna Levin. “Singularity,” by Marie Howe, was originally composed for and performed at The Universe in Verse, a celebration of science through poetry hosted by Janna Levin, and curated by Maria Popova at Pioneer Works in Brooklyn.&lt;/p&gt;

Aug 24, 2018, Part 2
</title><link>https://www.sciencefriday.com/episodes/august-24-2018/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;From 1976 to 2017, the Democratic Republic of the Congo experienced eight outbreaks of the deadly Ebola virus. Then, for 10 weeks earlier this year, the virus reemerged in the country, killing 33 people. Ministry of Health officials finally declared the crisis over on July 24. &lt;/span&gt;But just one week later, on August 1, the DRC reported &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/a-better-method-for-stopping-ebola-and-yellow-fever/" target="_blank"&gt;a new outbreak of the Ebola virus in North Kivu province&lt;/a&gt;. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the The National Institutes of Health, joins Ira for an update on the latest outbreak of the Ebola virus in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, &lt;span&gt;public health officials may not be able to control when and where a viral outbreak will occur. But, with the right strategy, they can keep it from becoming an epidemic. One of these strategies was used on yellow fever, a virus that emerged in Brazil last year and threatened major population centers like Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Nuno Faria of the University of Oxford describes &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/a-better-method-for-stopping-ebola-and-yellow-fever/" target="_blank"&gt;how his team used real time genome sequencing of the Yellow Fever virus&lt;/a&gt; to track where it came from and which groups might be at risk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the Southwest, water is at a premium, with every drop in demand from agriculture, industry, and growing populations. The Mexico-Texas border is no exception. Strict rules govern who can take water from the Rio Grande, with each country owing a certain amount of water to the other as the river winds back and forth. &lt;/span&gt;But the surface water isn’t the only liquid in play. Far below the surface, hidden aquifers straddle the border—and the water within them is largely unregulated. &lt;span&gt;Rosario Sanchez of the Texas Water Resources Institute and Zoe Schlanger, environment reporter for &lt;em&gt;Quartz &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/a-squishy-border-dispute-deep-below-texas-and-mexico/" target="_blank"&gt;discuss the water regulations and border disputes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Ministry of Health officials finally declared the crisis over on July 24. But just one week later, on August 1, the DRC reported <a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/a-better-method-for-stopping-ebola-and-yellow-fever/" target="_blank">a new outbreak of the Ebola virus in North Kivu province</a>. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the The National Institutes of Health, joins Ira for an update on the latest outbreak of the Ebola virus in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>Plus, public health officials may not be able to control when and where a viral outbreak will occur. But, with the right strategy, they can keep it from becoming an epidemic. One of these strategies was used on yellow fever, a virus that emerged in Brazil last year and threatened major population centers like Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Nuno Faria of the University of Oxford describes <a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/a-better-method-for-stopping-ebola-and-yellow-fever/" target="_blank">how his team used real time genome sequencing of the Yellow Fever virus</a> to track where it came from and which groups might be at risk.</p>
<p>In the Southwest, water is at a premium, with every drop in demand from agriculture, industry, and growing populations. The Mexico-Texas border is no exception. Strict rules govern who can take water from the Rio Grande, with each country owing a certain amount of water to the other as the river winds back and forth. But the surface water isn’t the only liquid in play. Far below the surface, hidden aquifers straddle the border—and the water within them is largely unregulated. Rosario Sanchez of the Texas Water Resources Institute and Zoe Schlanger, environment reporter for <em>Quartz </em><a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/a-squishy-border-dispute-deep-below-texas-and-mexico/" target="_blank">discuss the water regulations and border disputes</a>. </p>

They look for food, take care of the eggs, and dig all the tunnels. Fire ant colonies, for example, have hundreds of thousands of worker ants. You’d think traffic jams happen all the time. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/how-fire-ants-avoid-traffic-jams/" target="_blank"&gt;But they don’t&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The majority of the ants aren’t working, according to a study published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science &lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;this week from the Georgia Institute of Technology. They remain idle to stay out of the way, leaving only 30% of the ants to dig a new hole. The researchers also believe the dynamic between idle and active ants could be applied to teaching small robots to dig together at an earthquake site or find shelter underground during a natural disaster.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Long before humans enriched uranium to create nuclear fission, the Earth was doing it on its own. Two billion years ago, some natural deposits of uranium contained enough Uranium-235 to undergo spontaneous fission reactions. &lt;/span&gt;Those deposits are no longer undergoing fission. But, new research of the Oklo natural nuclear reactor in Gabon has found something curious. Not all the cesium (a toxic waste product of fission reactions both natural and man-made) was released into the environment. Rather, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/the-earth-invented-nuclear-reactors-before-we-did/" target="_blank"&gt;some remained bound in the reactor&lt;/a&gt;, with the help of other molecules. How could&lt;span&gt; this finding help lead to safer nuclear waste storage?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cancer happens when a cell picks up a mutation that causes it grow and divide out of control. Statistically, you would think then that larger-bodied organisms would have more cells and therefore more opportunities for mutation—increasing the risk of cancer. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/how-a-zombie-gene-helped-elephants-evolve-protection-from-cancer/" target="_blank"&gt;But for some bigger animals, this idea doesn’t hold true&lt;/a&gt;. This conundrum was first observed by epidemiologist Richard Peto and has become known as Peto’s Paradox. The elephant is one animal that falls under this paradox and has a lower cancer risk despite its large size. Scientists investigated the elephant genome to try to understand why this might happen—and identified a “zombie” gene, which is dormant in most mammals, but in elephants identifies and kills cells with damaged DNA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People love seeing black bears when they visit Yosemite National Park in California. But encounters don’t always go well. The park has come up with a new way to keep humans and bears safe. But tracking data from the past few years points to a new trend: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/traffic-poses-a-new-threat-to-yosemites-famous-bears/" target="_blank"&gt;Bears are being hit by cars, and speeding is now their biggest threat&lt;/a&gt;. Leahy says 28 were hit in 2016, and many of them died. In 2017, 23 bears were hit and four died. “You’re talking about 10 percent of our bears potentially being hit by vehicles each year,” said &lt;span&gt;Yosemite National Park wildlife biologist Ryan Leahy in&lt;/span&gt; 2017. “Just slowing down a little bit will give you that stopping distance required to prevent a collision.” The key, he says, is education. His team has created an interactive map-based website where the public can track the lives of selected bears and see general areas where they’re hit the most.&lt;/p&gt;

While climate change is certainly to blame in fanning the flames of wildfires (by boosting temperatures, parching landscapes, and causing more erratic rainfall) there's another factor that's making today's fires increasingly dangerous: a nearly 1,400 percent increase in the number of people building homes in harm's way since the 1940s. &lt;span&gt;Stephen Strader of Villanova University, Jon Keeley of the U.S. Geological Survey, and Erin Questad of Cal Poly Pomona join Ira &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/one-force-driving-deadlier-wildfires-people/"&gt;to talk about people in the way of fire&lt;/a&gt;—and how we can nurse those ecosystems back to health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you had a number one hit song, you would probably remember writing it. John Lennon and Paul McCartney wrote over 200 songs together over 50 years ago. So it’s no surprise that memories have gotten a little fuzzy when it comes to who wrote which Beatles song. Mark Glickman, senior lecturer in statistics at Harvard University and Beatles super-fan, developed an algorithm&lt;span&gt; to determine the authorship of “In My Life” and several other contested Beatles songs. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/who-wrote-that-beatles-song-this-algorithm-will-tell-you/"&gt;He (and his guitar) join Ira to discuss his findings.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

They’re in every ecosystem on the Earth, and researchers have hopes to someday find them on other planets. The tiny cells have even helped make our atmosphere &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;oxygen-rich and liveable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. But do bacteria—numerous and adaptable as they are—ever go extinct? New research &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/not-even-the-smallest-are-spared-extinction/" target="_blank"&gt;suggests they do. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Facial recognition systems—the type of technology that helps you tag your friends on Facebook—is finding its way offline and into real world environments. Some police departments are using the technology to help identify suspects and companies are marketing face-identifying software to schools to increase security. But a study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; found that facial recognition algorithms &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/is-facial-recognition-ready-for-the-real-world/" target="_blank"&gt;lacked in accuracy when it came to assessing different genders and skin tones. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you want to study something, the best way to do it is to go straight to the source. That goes for bodies in our solar system as well.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This week, Alan Alda spoke publicly &lt;span&gt;about living with Parkinson’s Disease for the first time since his diagnosis three and a half years ago. He’s known for his work as an actor, author, and science communicator. He joins Ira to discuss &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/alan-alda-opens-up-about-his-parkinsons-disease/" target="_blank"&gt;his life since his diagnosis.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;A six-year old Pittsburgh area boy underwent radical surgery in an attempt to treat a seizure-causing brain tumor. The boy’s entire occipital lobe and and much of his temporal lobe were removed—material that added up to about one-sixth of his total brain matter. Now, researchers report that the boy is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/after-a-radical-brain-surgery-a-normal-life/" target="_blank"&gt;living a surprisingly normal life despite the missing brain matter.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>https://www.sciencefriday.com/episodes/july-20-2018/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;If you hear the word “superbug,” you’re likely to think about drug-resistant bacteria or even viruses. But in a case that’s been unfolding since 2009, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/a-dangerous-fungal-superbug-in-hospitals-worldwide/" target="_blank"&gt;a drug-resistant yeast is increasingly worrying epidemiologists&lt;/a&gt;. The yeast, Candida auris, has popped up in 27 countries so far, with 340 cases in the United States. It has a mortality rate of 60 percent. Unlike other kinds of fungal infection, C. auris seems able to hop from person to person and persists on sterile surfaces. Inconveniently, the yeast’s spores are unusually resilient against standard hospital cleaning solutions. On top of that, it’s already resistant to most of the anti-fungal drugs in existence—there weren’t many of those to being with. &lt;span&gt;Science writer Maryn McKenna and CDC Chief of Mycotic Diseases Tom Chiller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;joins Ira&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; to discuss the underestimated risks of fungi and how health systems can combat them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One-hundred fifty million years ago, long-necked sauropods roamed the planet munching on plants and trees. Some of the largest herbivorous dinosaurs could grow up to 115 feet and weigh 80 tons. A team of scientists wanted to see how much nutrition this vegetarian diet provided for the dinosaurs. The group grew horsetails, ginkgos, and other plants similar to Mesozoic vegetation under high levels of carbon dioxide to mimic the atmosphere of the era. Paleontologist Fiona Gill, who is an author on that study, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/how-much-food-would-a-dino-eat-for-dinner/" target="_blank"&gt;talks about what we know about dinosaur digestion and how this could be used to model other ancient ecosystems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary Radabaugh peers over her mask at the toxic algae spread across Haney Creek off of the St. Lucie River in Florida. “You can see the flies that are on the top of it. They’re eating the rot so that’s like the sewage that is out there. You can see the big brown spots that look like sewage.” Here boats bob sadly in the blue-green algae that if ingested can cause nausea, diarrhea and vomiting and even can affect the liver and nervous system. But for Radabaugh that hardly is the worst of it, which is why she wears the paper mask over her mouth and nose. “The smell is comparable to a Port-O-Let that’s been sitting in the hot sun for about three months. It’s really probably the worst smell you’ve ever smelled.”  The toxic algae bloom is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/massive-toxic-algae-bloom-stinks-up-florida-towns/" target="_blank"&gt;the worst in modern history&lt;/a&gt; here where the Indian River Lagoon, St. Lucie River and Atlantic Ocean converge. Some 160 billion gallons of polluted water have been flushed from a rain-swollen Lake Okeechobee to the area since January, triggering the widespread bloom that has prompted emergency declarations in three counties.&lt;/p&gt;

And recently, two U.K. citizens were hospitalized. One died after apparent exposure to Novichok. Russia has so far denied any involvement in the attacks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The nuclear arms race wasn’t the only focus for the U.S. and Soviets during the Cold War. The proliferation of chemical weapons—nerve and blister agents like mustard gas—was also high on their priorities. The first nerve agent was the result of 1930’s German chemists’ experiments to develop new insecticides. The substance was toxic to insects but also, at certain doses, to animals and humans as well. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/the-chemistry-behind-nerve-agents/" target="_blank"&gt;Luckily, a brush with a nerve agent isn’t always fatal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Dr. Rick Sachleben joins Ira to discuss how nerve agents interact with our body chemistry and what can make a difference between life and death for someone who’s come into contact with the deadly substance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This week, coffee giant Starbucks announced that it was phasing out the use of plastic straws in its stores, instead using what some are calling “adult sippy cup” lids.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In late April, FIFA announced that they would be adding four more referees to each soccer match. These refs won’t be running alongside players. Instead, they’ll be in a control room watching the match closely on computer monitors. The video assistant referees will be scanning instant replay for the typical fouls like hand balls and offside goals—but they will also be monitoring soccer dives. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Soccer players are notorious for dives, or faking injuries. If players can successfully convince a referee they are temporarily injured, their team can get rewarded with a free kick, a yellow card for the opposing team, or the coveted penalty kick. If they get caught faking it, referees don’t really punish them. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/the-scientific-strategy-of-soccer-dives/" target="_blank"&gt;But there is a strategy to these flops&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;One study showed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; that players flopped when they were closer to referees and twice as much when the score was tied.

</title><link>https://www.sciencefriday.com/episodes/july-13-2018/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 1988, physicist Stephen Hawking’s wildly popular &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Brief History of Time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; introduced general audiences around the world to scientists’ questions about the Big Bang, black holes, and relativity. Many of those questions remain unanswered, though the science has advanced in the 30 years since the book was first published. Hawking, who passed away this spring, was known not just for this book, but for his enthusiastic and persistent communication with the public about science. And this summer, the Science Friday Book Club celebrates his legacy on the page, and off. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/read-a-brief-history-of-time-with-the-scifri-book-club/" target="_blank"&gt;Join Ira and the team at Science Friday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; as we read &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Brief History of Time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; and ponder the deep questions about matter, space, and time. We’ll read the book and discuss until late August. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/read-a-brief-history-of-time-with-the-scifri-book-club/" target="_blank"&gt;And we want to hear from you&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Neutrinos are particles that are constantly raining down in the universe. They are created from nuclear reactions in places like our sun, distant stars, and even on Earth. But the source of higher-energy cosmic neutrinos formed deeper in the universe is still a mystery. &lt;/span&gt;Researchers have built telescopes to detect these low and high energy neutrinos as they pass through the Earth. One of these telescopes is IceCube, which is buried deep beneath the ice in the Antarctic. In September, IceCube &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/following-a-neutrinos-four-billion-light-year-journey/" target="_blank"&gt;detected one of these cosmic neutrinos&lt;/a&gt; and alerted the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope and other observatories. These telescopes were able to trace the source of the neutrino to a flare up in a blazar—a black hole at the center of a galaxy—4 billion light-years away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When the mercury soars dangerously high, air conditioning can help save lives that might otherwise be lost to heat exhaustion, heat stroke, and other stresses brought about by heat waves. But there’s a downside: it can take a lot of electricity to keep you cool. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;New research&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; earlier this month assesses &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/under-climate-change-the-ac-giveth-and-the-ac-taketh-away/" target="_blank"&gt;what happens when the demand for air conditioning rises with the temperature&lt;/a&gt;, and why saving those lives might also cost lives. Senior author Tracey Holloway, a professor of atmospheric and oceanic science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, explains.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>https://www.sciencefriday.com/episodes/july-6-2018/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;In the 19th century, the American West was an arid climate yet to be fully explored. But surveyors like geologist John Wesley Powell, the second director of the United States Geological Society, would chart out the natural wonders that lied beyond the Mississippi. While at the USGS, Powell would lead a project to create the first map of the country to integrate geographical features and some of the first survey expeditions along the snaking Colorado River and Grand Canyon. But he also proposed radical ideas about developing the West that took the climate and ecology into account. One of Powell’s theories stated that the U.S. was divided down the middle along the “100th Meridian”—between the dry West region and moist East. In two recent studies, climatologist Richard Seager and his team confirmed this dividing line. Seager joins Ira to explain how this ecological division has changed due to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the Declaration of Independence was signed, Congress chose the bald eagle—a symbol of freedom—as the national bird. There were an estimated 100,000 eagles at that time. But the birds were nearly driven to extinction in the 1960s, with only with only 487 breeding pairs out in the wild. After the endangered species list was created and targeted conservation efforts began, eagle populations recovered. Researchers have found that one of the keys to recovery is protecting the nest of breeding pairs of eagles.&lt;/p&gt;

June 29, 2018, Part 1
</title><link>https://www.sciencefriday.com/episodes/june-29-2018/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Whales are majestic, awe-inspiring animals. Some species can reach up to 150 tons and take in a living room-sized volume of water in one gulp. They can even dive thousands of feet into the ocean while holding their breath all the way down. It’s hard to imagine that the earliest ancestors of these graceful creatures of the deep were four-legged dog-like animals that lived on land. In his book &lt;em&gt;Spying on Whales: The Past, Present, and Future of Earth’s Most Awesome Creatures&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/chasing-whales-through-time/"&gt;paleontologist Nick Pyenson examines their evolutionary story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus: Think back to your sex ed class in school. Chances are you were introduced to lots of new jargon too: Terms like spermatozoa, oviducts, chromosomes, germ cells and gonads. It was that last word, gonads—and a researcher who referred to them as “magical organs”—that sent &lt;em&gt;Radiolab&lt;/em&gt; producer and host Molly Webster on a quest to respark our fascination with embryonic development, X and Y chromosomes, and reproduction.

But mathematical thinking can help us understand what’s going on in society too, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/how-abstract-math-can-analyze-social-injustice/" target="_blank"&gt;says mathematician Eugenia Cheng&lt;/a&gt;. For example, abstract math can be used to examine the power structures between men and women, or white and black people, and to more clearly define the relationships and power differentials at play.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At our live event at the Harris Theater in Chicago, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/the-coyotes-of-chicago/" target="_blank"&gt;we called on WBEZ’s Curious City to help us out&lt;/a&gt;. Chicago resident Devin Henderson reached out to the Curious City team including editor Alexandra Solomon to learn more about the coyote population that call Chicago home. Wildlife biologist Chris Anchor, who’s part of Cook County’s Urban Coyote Project, talks about how coyotes made their way into Chicago and how they survive in an urban environment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people in Chicago probably remember the day meteorites fell from the sky. It’s known as the “Park Forest Meteor Shower” but it wasn’t the kind you stay up at night to watch streaking across the sky. Around midnight on March 27th, 2003, a meteorite exploded into pieces, showering the Chicago suburb of Park Forest, Illinois. People reported seeing stones falling through roofs and causing damage to homes. In the aftermath of the event, meteorite hunters descended on Park Forest looking to buy the rocks, creating a meteorite frenzy. But that didn’t stop Meenakshi Wadhwa, former curator of meteorites at the Chicago Field Museum, from getting her hands on one of these prized space rocks for the museum’s collection. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/science-friday-presents-two-wrongs-dont-make-a-meteorite/" target="_blank"&gt;Hear Ira and Chicago comedians&lt;/a&gt; Jimmy Adameck, Ross Taylor, and Jen Connor bring the event to life on stage in a play with musical scoring by Mary Mahoney.&lt;/p&gt;

June 22 2018, Part 1
</title><link>https://www.sciencefriday.com/episodes/june-22-2018/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Last week, the National Institutes of Health cancelled a $100 million study of alcohol and health &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/will-we-ever-know-how-moderate-drinking-affects-our-health/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;after an internal investigation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/will-we-ever-know-how-moderate-drinking-affects-our-health/" target="_blank"&gt; found&lt;/a&gt; “early and frequent” engagement with none other than the alcohol industry, to an extent that would “cast doubt” on the scientific results. But prior to the cancellation, the research was setting out to answer an ongoing question about alcohol and our health: Are moderate drinkers actually better off than nondrinkers? Study after study has found that light or moderate drinkers have a slight health advantage, especially in avoiding nonfatal heart attacks, but &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;is that because they drink, or is it due to some other factor like wealth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/after-8-undersea-days-cephalopod-week-2018-draws-to-a-close/" target="_blank"&gt;Cephalopod Week 2018&lt;/a&gt; has been a worldwide cephalo-bration of octopus, squid, cuttlefish, nautilus, and other undersea friends—but like a fast-jetting octopus, it goes by too quickly. As we wrap up Cephalopod Week this year, squid biologist Sarah McAnulty joins Ira to talk about her research into a symbiotic bacterial relationship in the Hawaiian bobtail squid, a lime-sized beastie that likes to bask on the Hawaiian sand. And Science Friday web producer Lauren Young joins the party to tell the story of a 19th-century self-taught French naturalist, Jeanne Villepreux-Power, who investigated the shell of the paper nautilus—and helped shape the design of early aquariums in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, corals are suffering from bleaching events due to rising ocean temperatures and human activity. The Great Barrier Reef has had bleaching events in 2016 and 2017, and the Pacific and western Atlantic ocean is currently experiencing a bleaching event that began in 2014. But in these tropical areas, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/a-possible-oasis-in-a-sea-of-dying-coral/" target="_blank"&gt;there are pockets of coral that are surviving these events while neighboring coral die out&lt;/a&gt;. A study published in the Journal of Applied Ecology described that “coral oases” provide a “glimmer of hope,” according to marine biologist Ilsa Kuffner. She talks about how these corals might be surviving and how it could be used for conservation.&lt;/p&gt;

Yet despite decades of searching and millions of dollars spent, physicists still haven't been able to track down a dark matter particle. In this segment, physicists Jodi Cooley and Flip Tanedo, and &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt; science writer Ryan Mandelbaum talk about how experimentalists and theorists are getting creative in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/dark-matter-eludes-particle-physicists/"&gt;the hunt for dark matter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

And she says we still don’t know enough about deep sea ecology to know how to protect these species, the ones we’ve found and the ones we haven’t yet, from mining. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;But accessing the deep ocean is expensive; it can cost anywhere from $50,000 to $100,000 a day to run a research ship. So roboticists and artificial intelligence designers are developing underwater drones to map and sniff out the secrets of the deep with the help of sophisticated chemical sensors. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;June 1 marks the start of the official “hurricane season” in the Atlantic, the time when powerful storms are most likely to spin their way out of the tropics. Each year, teams of forecasters try to anticipate the number and severity of storms to come. Some try to run climate models that simulate atmospheric behavior over multi-month timeframes, while other teams rely on statistics and comparisons with historic data for their estimates of the upcoming storm season. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Michael Bell, co-author of Colorado State University’s seasonal hurricane forecast, says that after looking at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;factors including &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Atlantic sea surface temperatures, sea level pressures, vertical wind shear levels, and El Niño, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/looking-ahead-to-hurricane-season/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;their &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/looking-ahead-to-hurricane-season/" target="_blank"&gt;team is predicting 13 additional named storms during the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season&lt;/a&gt; (in addition to Alberto, which formed before the Atlantic hurricane season began). Of those storms, the forecast calls for six to become hurricanes and two to reach major hurricane strength. That’s in line with a separate forecast from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center estimating between 10-16 named storms and 5-9 hurricanes.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/leaving-the-lab-for-the-hill/" target="_blank"&gt;why would a scientist want to leave the lab for the Hill&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/span&gt;According to volcanologist and Congressional candidate Jess Phoenix, “Science by definition is political because the biggest funder of scientific research in our country is the government.” And Aruna Miller, who is a Maryland State Delegate for District 15 and a former civil engineer for the Department of Transportation, says that “Your job as an engineer isn’t only your profession. It is to be a citizen of your country…. You have to be engaged in our community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;By now, we all know about the microbes that live in our gut and digestive tract—different species of bacteria living together in the same environment.

They’d cover up some reflectors, leave others uncovered, and then compare the results. “We covered them with this cheap, easily available and durable material, which just happened to be white canvas bags,” Riginos said. And to their surprise—the bags turned out to be more effective than the reflectors. “We could actually see that in the white bags situation, that the deer were more likely to stop and wait for cars to pass before crossing the road, instead of just running headlong into the road,” said Riginos.&lt;/p&gt;

Or what if you don’t think you like science enough to spend money on an entry fee? All of these are reasons one nonprofit is working to shrink the museum, and bring it to you—starting with the Smallest Mollusk Museum. <a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/the-portable-science-museum/" target="_blank">It’s a vending machine-sized exhibit</a> on the slimy tricks, strange brains, and ecological importance of snails, squids, octopuses, and their chitinous cousins. Amanda Schochet, co-founder of the project and a former computational biologist, explains what goes into making a small museum that can still share big ideas.</p>
<p>In recent years, medical providers have largely moved away from scrawled paper charts to electronic health records. <a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/bringing-electronic-health-records-into-the-modern-age/" target="_blank">But a team of researchers argues that the transformation of medical records hasn’t gone far enough</a>. While there has been widespread adoption of electronic health records, most are just static, flat translations of the format of the old fashioned paper file. If we can subscribe to specific categories of news online, the researchers say, why shouldn’t medical specialists be able to subscribe to a given patient’s medical records to get updates and alerts of specific interest to them? Why shouldn’t medical teams be able to get notifications and share information when patients needing special care plans arrive at the hospital?</p>

</title><link>https://www.sciencefriday.com/episodes/may-11-2018/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;How do you think about time? Most people experience it as Newton described it—as something that passes independent of other events, that’s the same for everyone, and moves in a straight line. Still, others have come to embrace Einstein’s view that time instead forms a matrix with space and acts like as a substance in which we are submerged. But physicist and author &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/a-case-for-why-time-may-just-not-exist/" target="_blank"&gt;Carlo Rovelli has an even different approach to time&lt;/a&gt;. He’s working on a way to quantify gravity in which time &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;doesn’t exist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An adult African elephant can weigh as much as two tons. Their activities—walking, playing, even bellowing—might shake the ground beneath them. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/a-stomp-a-roar-an-elephantquake/" target="_blank"&gt;But new research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/a-stomp-a-roar-an-elephantquake/" target="_blank"&gt; finds&lt;/a&gt; that the signals from an elephant’s walk are capable of traveling as far as three kilometers, while a male elephant might be detectable a full six kilometers away with just seismological monitoring tools. This new research could protect endangered elephants from poaching.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Reporter Ku`uwehi Hiraishi of Hawaii Public Radio &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/the-science-behind-kilaueas-30-year-eruption/" target="_blank"&gt;spoke to residents&lt;/a&gt; in the area of these 15 fissures and describes what type of evacuation efforts have been happening on the ground.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ten years ago, Dr. Gautam Dantas had one of those rare moments you hear about in science—a serendipitous discovery. He and his colleagues were trying to kill some bacteria they had collected from soil. So, naturally, they tried knocking them out with some antibiotics. &lt;/span&gt;They were unsuccessful. The soil bacteria were resistant to the drugs—but the bacteria ate the very antibiotics that were meant to kill them. The discovery came as a shock to Gautam and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/these-bacteria-can-help-fight-antibiotic-resistance/" target="_blank"&gt;he says it changed the course of his career&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to middle-of-the-road predictions, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;seas will rise by as much as two feet by 2060&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; in South Florida. Residents of Miami and surrounding counties have already seen that rise in action. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Citing a lack of action at the state and federal level to help the region adapt and plan, the editorial boards of three major newspapers, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Miami Herald&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sun Sentinel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Palm Beach Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/calling-for-action-on-floridas-rising-seas/" target="_blank"&gt;are teaming up&lt;/a&gt;.

<p>Ten years ago, Dr. Gautam Dantas had one of those rare moments you hear about in science—a serendipitous discovery. He and his colleagues were trying to kill some bacteria they had collected from soil. So, naturally, they tried knocking them out with some antibiotics. They were unsuccessful. The soil bacteria were resistant to the drugs—but the bacteria ate the very antibiotics that were meant to kill them.

</title><link>https://www.sciencefriday.com/episodes/april-27-2018/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s not uncommon these days to hear scientists and journalists say that our planet is experiencing record-setting temperatures due to climate change. But they’re talking about a small part of Earth’s history—human history. The story of the earth’s climate contains much more than what human beings have recorded. I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;n their new book, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Weather: An Illustrated History&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, longtime climate reporter Andrew Revkin and co-author Lisa Mechaley &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/four-billion-years-of-climate-change/" target="_blank"&gt;track the incredible range of climate history&lt;/a&gt;. They condense that history—from the formation of Earth’s early atmosphere to the invention of temperature, the tracking of tornados and the discovery of greenhouse gases—into a digestible timeline of 100 weather-related events.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/help-us-weigh-galaxies/" target="_blank"&gt;Science Friday is partnering with citizen science platform Zooniverse&lt;/a&gt; to help a team of astrophysicists identify galaxies showing an astronomical phenomenon known as gravitational lensing&lt;span&gt;. Gravitational lensing occurs when the light coming from a galaxy, quasar, or other bright object is bent and distorted by a massive object in front of it, giving the light the appearance of passing through a “lens,” like how an image appears through a magnifying glass. These lenses are rare, but incredibly neat. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, a gravitational lens essentially allows us to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;weigh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; a galaxy. Pretty cool, right? But, we need &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;your &lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/aprajita/space-warps-hsc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;help&lt;/a&gt; to find more lenses! With the aid of the citizen science website Zooniverse, everyone can take part in this real, cutting-edge area of research. You can help contribute to making a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;real &lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;discovery!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Plus, on this week's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/when-great-lakes-water-is-public-and-when-it-isnt/" target="_blank"&gt;State of Science&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;Foxconn's Lake Michigan bid raises questions about interpreting a young law—when water is public and when it isn't.&lt;/p&gt;

The Bajau are “sea nomads,” meaning they get everything they need to live by diving up to 65 feet under water, multiple times, for up to 8 hours a day.

April 20, 2018, Part 1
</title><link>https://www.sciencefriday.com/episodes/april-20-2018/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The 1783 eruption of Laki in Iceland lasted eight months, blanketing parts of the island in lava flows 50 feet deep, and spewing noxious gases that devastated crops and poisoned livestock. Tens of thousands died in Iceland, but the eruption killed millions more around the world, when ash from the eruption cooled the Earth, ushering in an icy winter, and weakening monsoons across Africa and Asia. In her new book &lt;em&gt;The Big Ones: How Natural Disasters Have Shaped Us (and What We Can Do About Them), &lt;/em&gt;seismologist Lucy Jones describes the devastation of Laki and other geological disasters. She joins Ira to discuss natural calamities throughout human history, from Pompeii to Fukushima, and why humans have such trouble planning for and responding to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/240-257-lucy-jones-the-big-ones-ci/"&gt;the uncertainty of natural disasters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence is mounting that hydraulic fracturing—fracking—is causing at least some increase in earthquakes in the U.S. From Oklahoma to Ohio, researchers have linked spikes in earthquakes to the added pressure of water too close to fault lines. Often these quakes have been linked to post-operation wastewater injections. But when will a fracking operation itself cause an earthquake? &lt;span&gt;Miami University geologists Michael Brudzinski and Brian Currie join Ira to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/a-fingerprint-scan-for-earthquakes-caused-by-fracking/"&gt;discuss their findings&lt;/a&gt; in the bedrock of eastern Ohio.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus: Humans have made the world a pretty tough place for our fellow species to live. As a species, we’re raising global temperatures, destroying natural habitats, and littering the oceans with our junk. But that’s not bad news at all for one adaptive bacteria. In 2016, scientists discovered that &lt;em&gt;Ideonella sakaiensis&lt;/em&gt; had evolved to produce an enzyme that enabled it to eat plastic bottles. Now this week, scientists have discovered a way to tweak that enzyme to do the work 20 percent faster. &lt;em&gt;Popular Science&lt;/em&gt; senior editor Sophie Bushwick joins Ira to discuss how researchers are looking to harness the bacteria’s penchant for plastic trash, and other science headlines, in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/the-next-all-natural-recycling-solution-an-enzyme/"&gt;the News Round-up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The height of those levee walls is regulated by the Army Corps of Engineers to ensure that riverside districts equally bear the risk of flooding. But some districts have piled more sand atop their levees to protect against imminent flood risk during emergency conditions—and then left those sandbags there after the danger passed, leaving a system of levees with irregular heights. A team of investigative reporters at &lt;span&gt;ProPublica has shown &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;that those higher levee walls protect the people and developments behind them, but &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/unequal-levees-could-leave-some-towns-to-drown/" target="_blank"&gt;shift the risk of flooding onto neighboring communities&lt;/a&gt; who have followed the rules.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

March 30, 2018, Part 2</itunes:title><itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>According to CDC data, more than 13,000 people die from gun homicides every year—and most of them are people of color who live in urban areas. Many of them are children. But as scientists seek to understand the causes and solutions for gun deaths, can we also learn to predict them…and even intervene before they happen? <a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/can-we-predict-urban-gun-homicides/" target="_blank">One researcher may have the answer</a>: social media analysis. </p>
<p>Friendly neighbors. Olympic divers. Little horses with wings. No matter what you call the commonly misunderstood bat, they’re far more than simple nocturnal blood-drinkers. <a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/little-bats-impressive-resumes/" target="_blank">Bats have an impressive repertoire of noteworthy abilities</a>—from super echolocation to agile, muscular wings. It’s a subject that has both inspired and lured scientists, like Sharon Swartz, a biologist who researches bat flight at Brown University. In this segment, she discusses how she takes a close look at the aerodynamics and wing morphology of these creatures to pin down the evolutionary origins of bat flight.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/the-interstitium-a-new-organ-that-could-explain-the-mysteries-of-the-human-body/" target="_blank">Scientists have discovered a new piece of human anatomy we never knew we had</a>—a layer of connective tissue that exists all over the body. It sits below the skin’s surface, lining the digestive tract, the lungs, and even our blood vessels. Researchers say it could be the missing link the medical community needs to move forward in a number of areas of research, including cancer and autoimmune disease.</p>

&lt;p&gt;This week, a panel of peer reviewers met for three days to discuss a draft report on two long-running studies on the potential health effects of cell phone radiation. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/is-there-a-cell-phone-link-to-cancer-a-definite-maybe/" target="_blank"&gt;In their conclusions&lt;/a&gt;, and voted to increase the level of confidence in the findings, saying that there was a clear link between the radiofrequency radiation exposure and the male rat heart tissue tumors. The National Toxicology Program now has to decide whether to accept the panel’s recommendation before the final report is released.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this week's State of Science, a judge requested a climate science tutorial in a federal lawsuit where two California cities are suing the oil company Chevron. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/climate-science-goes-to-court-in-california-oil-case/" target="_blank"&gt;In an unprecedented courtroom tutorial on climate science&lt;/a&gt;, Chevron went on record agreeing with the scientific consensus that people are causing global warming. But the company also deflected any responsibility for it under federal law and played up uncertainties in projections for both the volume and future consequences of greenhouse gas emissions. The tack signals a potential legal defense against financial liability for climate change impacts such as rising sea levels.&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>https://www.sciencefriday.com/episodes/march-16-2018/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Theoretical physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking died this week at the age of 76. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hawking challenged and inspired a generation of physicists, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/remembering-stephen-hawking/" target="_blank"&gt;we remember his life and legacy. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Plus, blockchain is the technology that makes possible every transaction made with Bitcoin—or any digital currency, for that matter. And when Bitcoin skyrocketed on the stock market last year, it turned average Joes into millionaires. Why just Joes? Most surveys show that 95 percent of blockchain enthusiasts and crypto investors are male. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/why-arent-there-more-women-in-blockchain/" target="_blank"&gt;We discuss the future of women in blockchain.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then, inside the fossilized bones of &lt;em&gt;Archaeopteryx&lt;/em&gt;, one of the earliest bird-like dinosaur specimens, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/to-flap-perchance-to-fly/" target="_blank"&gt;researchers have found evidence of a capability for flight. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, what does a &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tyrannosaurus rex &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;actually look like?
